# Firmware
This is the Corne v1-v3(rev1) firmware guideã€‚

## Flash the firmware

### Use [Remap](https://remap-keys.app/catalog/EfziB9K7ZcxLnIHXl5AQ/firmware)
The easiest and most recommended way is to go to Remap and select FLASH for crkbd:via.

Once the firmware has been written to one side, follow the same procedure for the other side.

### Use [QMK Toolbox](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_toolbox)

Download the firmware of VIA from [crkbd_rev1_via.hex](https://github.com/foostan/kbd_firmware/blob/main/keyboards/crkbd/qmk/qmk_firmware/.build/crkbd_rev1_via.hex)

With the keyboard connected via USB,
press the reset button **twice** or short **GND & RST** pins on ProMicro to start flashing the firmware. \
If you see the message, it's done.

Once the firmware has been written to one side, follow the same procedure for the other side.
